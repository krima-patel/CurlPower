## Target Audience and Purpose

Curl Power is an application designed for individuals with naturally curly hair, either looking to give or seek advice when it comes to their hair care journey. There are a myriad of ways to take care of curly hair, but often times, essential details about maintainence and product guidelines are missing, especially when it comes down to each hair type. Giving curly haired guys and gals a space dedicated to embracing thier natural hair is important for self-love and self-care. Curl Power encourages healthy hair care by allowing users to spread the word on routines and products that have elevated their curly hair game. This is achieved by sharing detailed, step-by-step routines and the products used for each hair type.
